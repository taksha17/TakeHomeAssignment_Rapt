The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a cornerstone of statistics. It states that if you take sufficiently large random samples from a population with any shape of distribution, the distribution of the *sample means* will approximate a normal distribution (a bell curve).

**How to use this dashboard:**
1.  **Choose a population distribution** from the sidebar. Notice that some are not bell-shaped at all!
2.  **Adjust the sample size (n)**, which is how many data points are in each sample.
3.  **Adjust the number of samples**, which is how many times we repeat the sampling experiment.

Watch how the histogram on the right, the *Distribution of Sample Means*, becomes more and more like a perfect bell curve as you increase the sample size, regardless of the original population's shape.
